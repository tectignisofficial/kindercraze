              <ul class="ul-check list-unstyled danger">
                <h4>How does the school decide if the educational software or apps it uses protect my kid's privacy?</h4>  
                <li>Your kid's school should review the privacy policies of any software or device that requires your kid to log in with a screen name and password. You can ask for a copy of the product's privacy policy, or you can talk to the teacher or your principal to get assurances that they know what they're doing.</li>
              <br>
                <h5>What you should hear in the school's answer :</h5>
              <li>Stored data is encrypted, password protected, and only available to certain administrators who need it for educational purposes. Ask who that person is.</li>
              <li>More than one person (for example, a teacher, administrator, and an IT professional) reviews the companies' policies. Ask for their names in case you need them.</li>
            <br>
            <h4>Who can get access to the school's list of students and their contact information?</h4>
            <li>Federal law limits who can get access to a school's directory of basic stuff like your kid's name, address, telephone number, and other general information.</li><br>
            <br>
            <h5>What you should hear in the school's answer:</h5>
            <li>Schools comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) by notifying parents of any information that they collect and what directory information includes, as well as providing parents the choice to to opt out.</li>
            <li>The method of notification is up to the school, so ideally they should use methods that will get your attention, such as a letter sent home that you have to sign. Ask how they notify parents: by email, a letter home, etc.?</li>
            </ul>

              <br>
              <ul class="ul-check list-unstyled danger">
                <h4>What information does the school collect and how is it stored?</h4>  
                <li>Schools need to offer a clear educational purpose for any personal information it asks for. (Social Security numbers are an example of information many schools have collected in the past, but not any longer because they couldn't justify the educational purpose of collecting that data.)</li><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>What you should hear in the school's answer:</h5>
                <li>The school asks for basic identification only -- for example, name, address, and phone number.</li>
                <li>The school encrypts any information it receives and uses security procedures to protect any data in transit. That means no one can read the information without authorized security clearance and a password. Ask how they do this.</li>
             <br>
                <h4>When do I need to provide consent for my student to use software at school?</h4>
                <li>Schools are allowed to provide consent on behalf of parents when they're using an app that collects information solely for educational purposes, such as an app that helps teachers take attendance. </li>
               <br>
                <h5>What you should hear in the school's answer:</h5>
                <li>Schools should notify parents, for example as a list on their webpage, of all educational software that the school has consented to students using, what data it's collecting, how the data is used, and how the data is protected.</li>
                <li>Schools should generally not ask for parental consent as a way to limit their own liability. When schools ask for consent, the school should have verified beforehand that the software is safe and that there is no safer or non-commerical alternative that could substitute for that software.</li>
